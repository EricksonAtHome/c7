# C7  (Central Generation Seven)

C7 (Central Generation Seven) is a blockchain based on the X11 algorithm, designed for transmitting data through the block explorer. We have opted to remove Mysql and other databases in favor of a decentralized database (C7) to optimize trust. This allows us to decentralize our own web and mobile apps, as well as those of others. Be self-sufficient in everything.
